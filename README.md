# Advanced Voice Recognition System

An advanced voice recognition system built using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), designed for real-time speech-to-text transcription with support for various English dialects.

## Features

- 🎙️ Real-time continuous speech recognition  
- 🌎 Support for multiple English dialects  
- 📊 Confidence scoring for recognition results  
- 📝 Recognition history tracking  
- 🧱 Robust error handling and logging  
- 🔒 Thread-safe implementation  

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- A working microphone  
- At least 2GB of free disk space for the speech recognition model  

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download the Vosk Model

This project uses the vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905 model for high-accuracy English recognition.
	•	Visit the Vosk Models Page
	•	Scroll to the “Other models” section
	•	Download the vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905.zip
Direct link: Download Model
	•	Extract the downloaded ZIP file
	•	Move the extracted folder (vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905) into your project directory

Usage
	1.	Ensure the model folder is in the project directory
	2.	Run the system:
 
```bash
python voice_recognition.py
```

	3.	Start speaking. The system will:
	•	Detect your voice
	•	Transcribe your speech
	•	Display text and confidence scores
	•	Log the recognition history
	4.	Press Ctrl + C to stop the system

Advanced Configuration

You can customize recognition behavior by changing parameters in the AdvancedVoiceRecognition class:
	•	model_path: Path to the Vosk model directory
	•	sample_rate: Audio sampling rate (default: 16000)
	•	device: Microphone device ID (default: None to use system default)

Troubleshooting

Microphone Not Detected
	•	Ensure it’s plugged in correctly
	•	Try a different device ID
	•	Close other applications that might be using the microphone

Low Recognition Accuracy
	•	Move to a quiet environment
	•	Speak clearly and naturally
	•	Test with a different Vosk model if needed
